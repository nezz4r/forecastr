# About The Project

## üëÄ Preview

The project can be previewed at https://forecastr.raulv.tech

<br/>

## üåê Overview

This weather forecast app is made with React, Next.js and styled with styled-components.

It supports geolocalization, city searching autocomplete, and displays lots of relevant info about your current weather.

<br/>

## üöÄ Features

### Geolocalization

When you first enter the app, it asks to know your location, if you accept, it can then show you weather forecast for your current position.

### City searching

The input box for city searching has autocomplete built-in, thanks to [Teleport API](https://developers.teleport.org/api/)

Update: This feature is not working right now as Teleport API is down for mainenance, all errors are handled so the app continues to work with limited functionality, only fetching your weather data from geolocalization.

### Weather Forecast

Weather forecast is very accurate and detailed, thanks to [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/).

It shows thermal sensation, humidity, pressure, wind speed, forecasted temp for the next 6 hours and max-min temperatures for the next 6 days.

### Metric and Imperial units

You can toggle between metric and imperial units via the second button next to the search bar

Note that when you toggle the unit, date and time formats also change from 'DD/MM' to 'MM/DD' and '14:00' to '2 PM'

## Upcoming Features

### LocalStorage Support

LocalStorage is already 95% implemented via the 'useLocalStorage' custom hook, it only needs to be debbuged. To try to use it, you can change any 'useState' to the custom hook 'useLocalStorage' with no changes other than to provide a 'key' for each state as the first argument.

```javascript
const [state, setState] = useLocalStorage('key', 'initial state');
```

### Theming Support

Theming Support is already 80% done, but a way to actually pass in the other theme object needs to be implemented via styled-components 'ThemeContext' .

It will also need a way for the user to toggle between themes.
